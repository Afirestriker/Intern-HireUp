# Intern & HireUp (Java Full Stack Project)
![WelcomePage](./ScreenShots/welcomePage.JPG)

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for.

The Intern & HireUp Project is a game-changer for college administrators. 
It allows them fast and reliable access to student's personal, academic, 
and skills records. This system gives them an overview of the student's 
details and a resumes viewing facility. With the ability to search for 
student records and print reports, it's a time-saving solution for 
college administrators. 

The best part is that it's reduced error, secure, reliable, and fast! 
So, administrators can focus on other important tasks and leave the 
record-keeping to the system. It's a win-win situation as it helps 
organizations better utilize their resources. With computerized 
records, there's no need for redundant entries, and administrators 
can easily access relevant information without any distractions.

## :scroll: Lessons Learned

No matter what type of project you are building or working on, the experience and the knowledge you gain from it cannot be measure.
Some of the thing that I learned while building this project is that creating a project is not a one day task and you need to be consistent.
Keep building, converting and enjoying the process of tranfering the idea into anobject.
Aslo note that mistakes are their to happen, but you should not shy from it, note it, analysed it, and learned from it. This could prevent it from happening again.

Some of main lession I learned:
- Start with a plan, Brainstorm and not just directly jump on it.
- If its a large projects, then divide it into modules.
- Make prototype / Wireframe of your idea/module. This will prevent any future problem and save time.
- Document as you build and not postponed it to the end.

# "Build, make mistake, learned from it and build again."
